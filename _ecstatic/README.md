# Ecstatic
Ecstatic is a static web site generator for [Pharo](http://www.pharo.org). Ecstatic uses pillar as its markup language to describe pages, mustache templates to accommodate your content and plugins completely written in Pharo.

### About Pillar 

Pillar is a document model for [Pharo](http://www.pharo.org) that can be exported to different formats such as HTML or LaTex. Pillar defines also a syntax to describe documents and provides a parser for it. To know a bit more about how to write pillar documents you may find useful the two following links.

### Web hosting deployment methods

Static web sites can be deployed in a large number of ways.  Instruction for other staic generators like Jekyll can be a useful reference

### TODOs

- Plugins should be parameterized with the site and use always files relative to the origin
- last changes to citezen should be commited
- extend pillar annotations to declare plugins
